# Amazon-Order-History

For this project, the purpose of looking through my csv file is to go through my amazon order history and answer some questions.
When done with my analysis, all my questions should be answered. This project will help me better understand how pandas and
jupyter notebook is to be utilized. There are multiple people in which my account is used. So. the questions will be on how
our orders differ or align.

## Questions to be answered

The csv being used, `Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv`, is a csv I downloaded to provide an analysis on my order history from Amazon.
I will also be using the csv, `orders_amazon.csv`, which was created from doing data manipulaitons on the `Retail.OrderHistory.1.csv` csv.

I will answer these questions with the help of Jupyter Notebook and pandas

- Who spent the most money in the current year so far? (2023)
- Who has made the most orders?
- How much money was spent bewtween everyone on the account?
- Is there a category that was purchased the most out of everyone?
- Which category for each person was spent on the most?
- Out of every year, who spent the most money for those respective years?

## Visualization

My goal is to create a visualization of the data collected by graphing and tabling it

I will chart or plot this information so that the visualization is clear
